**Online Boutique** is a cloud-first microservices demo application.  The application is a
web-based e-commerce app where users can browse items, add them to the cart, and purchase them.

**ü§ñ NEW: AI-Powered Shopping Agents** - This application now features an advanced AI agent system powered by **Gemini 2.5 Flash** that provides intelligent shopping assistance through natural language conversations, image analysis, and personalized product recommendations.

Google uses this application to demonstrate how developers can modernize enterprise applications using Google Cloud products, including: [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), [Cloud Service Mesh (CSM)](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh), [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), [Cloud Operations](https://cloud.google.com/products/operations), [Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner), [Memorystore](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore), [AlloyDB](https://cloud.google.com/alloydb), **[Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/)**, **[Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai)**, **[Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql)**, and **[Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage)**. This application works on any Kubernetes cluster.

## Quickstart (GKE)

1. Ensure you have the following requirements:
   - [Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#creating_a_project).
   - Shell environment with `gcloud`, `git`, and `kubectl`.

2. Clone the latest major version.

   ```sh
   git clone --depth 1 --branch v0 https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo.git
   cd microservices-demo/
   ```

   The `--depth 1` argument skips downloading git history.

3. Set the Google Cloud project and region and ensure the Google Kubernetes Engine API is enabled.

   ```sh
   export PROJECT_ID=<PROJECT_ID>
   export REGION=us-central1
   gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com \
     --project=${PROJECT_ID}
   ```

   Substitute `<PROJECT_ID>` with the ID of your Google Cloud project.

4. Create a GKE cluster and get the credentials for it.

   ```sh
   gcloud container clusters create-auto online-boutique \
     --project=${PROJECT_ID} --region=${REGION}
   ```

   Creating the cluster may take a few minutes.

5. Deploy Online Boutique to the cluster.

   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f ./release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml
   ```

6. Wait for the pods to be ready.

   ```sh
   kubectl get pods
   ```

   After a few minutes, you should see the Pods in a `Running` state:

   ```
   NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

   redis-cart-5f59546cdd-5jnqf              1/1     Running   0          2m58s
   shippingservice-6ccc89f8fd-v686r         1/1     Running   0          2m58s
   ```

7. Access the web frontend in a browser using the frontend's external IP.

   ```sh
   kubectl get service frontend-external | awk '{print $4}'
   ```

   Visit `http://EXTERNAL_IP` in a web browser to access your instance of Online Boutique.

8. Congrats! You've deployed the default Online Boutique. To deploy a different variation of Online Boutique (e.g., with Google Cloud Operations tracing, Istio, etc.), see [Deploy Online Boutique variations with Kustomize](#deploy-online-boutique-variations-with-kustomize).

9. Once you are done with it, delete the GKE cluster.

   ```sh
   gcloud container clusters delete online-boutique \
     --project=${PROJECT_ID} --region=${REGION}
   ```

   Deleting the cluster may take a few minutes.
